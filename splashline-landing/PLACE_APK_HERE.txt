PLACE YOUR APK FILE HERE

Instructions:
1. Build your Android APK from the main project
2. Copy the APK file to this directory
3. Rename it to: splashline.apk
4. Remove this text file

Example command:
cp ../android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-universal-release.apk ./splashline.apk

The landing page expects the APK to be named exactly "splashline.apk"

Note: If your APK is larger than 100MB, you may need to:
- Use Git LFS (Large File Storage) for GitHub
- Host the APK on a separate file hosting service
- Update the download link in index.html and script.js
